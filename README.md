# Rancid Tomatillos

## Overview
Rancid Tomatillos is a Mod 3 paired project for Turing, School of Software and Design. From start to completion we had one week to learn all of the concepts to create a front-end movie website using React, Router and Cypress for testing. 

## Learning Goals
* Gain competency with React fundamentals
* Make several network requests and handle asynchronous JS
* Test React application with Cypress
* Create a multi-page application using Router
* Practice refactoring

## Challenges
When refactoring our code to use Router v6 we ran into some challenges in identifying what step in our refactor were problematic. During the refactor process, we were unable to render our site in the browser until all of the refactor changes were made. As a result, if we made a mistake it was initally difficult to identify the exact issues without extensive debugging and console.logs. 

## Wins
After some difficulties with refactoring our app to use Router, we broke up the implementation steps into smaller, more manageable pieces as well as having a clear plan in place ahead of time. In the end we were able to implement router! Another win was setting up a detailed Excalidraw file in order to plan out our entire app from a big picture standpoint and also on a more granular level. The Excalidraw also made it possible for excellent communication and collaboration since we were working both synchronously and asynchronously throughout the project. 


## Set Up
1.  Fork this repo
2.  Clone **and rename** this repo: `git clone [remote-address] [new-name]`  
   For example: `git clone git@github.com:turingschool-examples/rancid-tomatillos-starter.git rancid-tomatillos`
4.  `cd` into the directory
5.  Install necessary dependencies with `npm install`
6.  Run your React app with `npm start`
7.  Go to `http://localhost:3000/` and you should see a page with some starter elements
8.  Enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop running the React app at any time
9. To run Cypress tests, use `npx cypress open`
