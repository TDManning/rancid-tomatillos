# Rancid Tomatillos - Starter Repo

## Overview
Rancid Tomatillos is a Mod 3 paired project for Turing, School of Software and Design. From start to completion we had one week to learn all of the concepts to create a front-end movie website using React, Router and Cypress for testing. 

## Learning Goals
* Gain competency with React fundamentals
* Make several network requests and handle asynchronous JS
* Test React application with Cypress
* Create a multi-page application using Router
* Practice refactoring
